6) Once you click on the Install button indicated above, you will be redirected to the Retainful page, where you will be asked to set up a password for your Retainful account. This would happen only on the first time. If you are a registered user, then you will be asked to login.

7) Post setting up a password for your account, or logging in(if you are an existing user), you will be asked to set up a store logo.
The logo that you upload here would be used as the store logo on the abandoned cart emails and next order coupon emails.
NOTE: If you wish to change this logo in future, you could do so by logging in to Retainful->Settings and change the store logo.
