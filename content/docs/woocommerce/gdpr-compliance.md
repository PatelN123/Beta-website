As  part of the GDPR compliance, it becomes essential that you display a notice informing users that you would be saving their emails and cart information.

Retainful lets you comply with GDPR by providing an option to display a GDPR notice on your storefront at the checkout, Add to cart popup form and Exit intent popup.

### Enabling GDPR notice

To enable GDPR notice on the checkout page, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your site. Go to **Woocommerce->Retainful- Abandoned carts ->Settings**.
2. Set **Enable GDPR compliance?** to Yes. Mention the compliance message that you wish to display on the checkout page:

![GDPR notice](../../images/docs/gdpr-compliance/GDPR-notice-checkout.png)
3. Save the settings.

4. **Frontend view**- Here is how users view the notice at the checkout page:
