### Adding Premium Features to your WooCommerce store

If you do not have an account already, sign up for a [Retainful Account free](https://app.retainful.com/?utm_source=enabling_premium_add_ons&utm_medium=retainful_account_free&utm_campaign=docs) and get started with a 14-day free trial. 

You can try all the features of the Retainful Premium during the trial period free of cost.

> NOTE: If your trial has expired, please upgrade to a paid plan in order to continue to use the premium add-ons.

#### Configure the Premium Add-ons

#### Having lower versions of Retainful ?

Since 2.0.1 version, we have merged the Premium add-ons into Retainful core plugin itself. So you don't need a separate Retainful Premium plugin. 
Just update to the Retainful 2.0.1 or higher. You will get all the premium features. 

> Note: If you already installed and activated the Retainful premium plugin, you can just de-activate it. It is no longer required for using the Premium features.
